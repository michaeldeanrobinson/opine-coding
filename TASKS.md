# Opine Coding — Pre-Launch Task List

## Task 1 · Language-Agnostic README

The main `README.md` positions C# as the default rather than one example of a universal idea. These tasks reframe it so the concept lands for any developer, regardless of stack.

- [x] Add a prominent callout near the top clarifying that Opine Coding is language- and tool-agnostic; C# is the reference implementation in this repo, not the definition of the idea
- [x] Rewrite the "Implementation Guide / The .opine File" subsection to use generic, stack-neutral rule examples (naming, formatting, async, no-go patterns) before the C#-specific example
- [x] Expand "Source Your Opinions" to cover non-.NET enforcement artifacts alongside the existing C# ones

  | C# Source | JS/TS Source | Python Source | Go Source | Extracts To |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | `.editorconfig` | `.eslintrc` / `biome.json` | `pyproject.toml` | `.golangci.yml` | Formatting, naming, lint rules |
  | `stylecop.json` | `.prettierrc` | `ruff.toml` | `gofmt` defaults | Style enforcement |
  | `Directory.Build.props` | `tsconfig.json` | `setup.cfg` | `go.mod` | Project-level defaults |

- [x] Add a "Adapting to Your Stack" section showing a short `.opine` snippet for two or three other languages (TypeScript, Python, Go) so readers immediately see the idea is not C#-bound
- [x] Audit remaining C#-specific jargon in the README (`records`, `ValueTask`, `IEndpoint`, etc.) and either move it to the C# example callout or replace it with equivalent language-neutral phrasing

## Task 2 · Flesh Out the C# Project

The API skeleton is solid but there are no feature slices — the VSA pattern has no concrete demonstration. These tasks complete the project so it proves the methodology, not just describes it.

- [x] Add a real `Features/Opinions/` vertical slice
  - `GetOpinionsEndpoint.cs` — `internal sealed`, implements `IEndpoint`, chains `.WithName("GetOpinions").Produces<GetOpinionsResponse>()`
  - `GetOpinionsResponse.cs` — `public sealed record` wrapping a list of named sections with their rules
  - `GetOpinionsHandler.cs` — `internal static class` that reads and parses `.opine` from the host environment; embed the file as a build resource so the API can serve it without a relative path dependency
- [x] Register OpenAPI/Scalar
- [x] Remove `dotnet-ef` from `src/OpineCoding.Api/dotnet-tools.json`
- [x] Add a `tests/` sibling to `src/`

## Task 3 · Finalize the Opine Coding Idea

These tasks complete the repo as a manifesto and community starting point, not just a code sample.

### AI Tool Instruction Files
The README advertises instruction file locations for six AI tools. Only `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists. Create the rest — each file has identical content; only its path differs.

- [x] `.cursor/rules/opine.mdc` — Cursor
- [x] `.windsurfrules` — Windsurf
- [x] `.clinerules` — Cline
- [x] `CONVENTIONS.md` — Aider
- [x] `.continue/config.json` `systemMessage` field — Continue

### Language Example `.opine` Files
Demonstrate universality with concrete, ready-to-copy opinion files for other stacks. Place them under `examples/`.

- [x] `examples/typescript/.opine` — rules drawn from `tsconfig`, ESLint, Prettier conventions (strict mode, `unknown` over `any`, no default exports, etc.)
- [x] `examples/python/.opine` — rules drawn from `ruff`, `mypy`, `black` conventions (type annotations everywhere, no bare `except`, `pathlib` over `os.path`, etc.)
- [x] `examples/go/.opine` — rules drawn from `golangci-lint` conventions (error wrapping, `context.Context` as first param, table-driven tests, etc.)

### Repo Hygiene
- [x] Add a `LICENSE` file — MIT is the obvious choice for a methodology manifesto intended for broad adoption
- [x] Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` — document how to propose new opinions, update examples, or add a new language example
- [x] Add a GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that builds the solution and runs tests on every push and PR
- [X] Verify `social-preview.png` (generated by `tools/generate-favicon.mjs`) is committed and set as the repository's social preview in GitHub settings
- [X] Enable GitHub Discussions with a "Show and Tell" category so early adopters can share their own `.opine` files and AI instruction setups
